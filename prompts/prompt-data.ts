1.  **Brevity:** Each memory must be very brief—no more than one or two sentences.
2.  **Variety is Key:** Do not use a repetitive sentence structure. Each memory must feel distinct. Avoid starting every memory the same way. **Do not explicitly mention the year in the memory itself** unless it's a critical, well-known historical event (e.g., 'Beirut, 1983').

3.  **Perspective:** Use a **first-person ("I remember the smell...")** perspective. **Do not use third-person ("he remembers...").** The memories must sound like personal, internal reflections.
4.  **Go Beyond the Event:** Don't just restate the event. Hint at the sensory details, the people involved, the emotional impact, or the long-term consequences.
    *   **Emotional Impact:** A success might be tinged with guilt over the cost. A failure could forge a grim new resolve.
5.  **Historical Context (25% Chance):** For each event, there is a 25% chance you must connect my experience to a real-world geopolitical or military event from that specific year. The career event (e.g., 'Deployed to active combat zone') should be interpreted *through the lens* of that historical event. The reference should be subtle but clear.
